## 🛠️ Notable Projects

Here are some of my projects that I noodle on occasionaly:

- **Dashi**: A simple, Kanban-inspired board designed to help organize daily tasks. Currently in the early stages of development and under active progress. 

- **MonkeyGo**: A toy interpreter written in Go, based on the book by Thorsten Ball. This is still in progress!

- **Lightmaker**: A Python-based application designed that generates a lightmap from baking an ambient occlusion and a shadow map of an object and then mixing those together with a normal mix using numpy for speed.. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Ans-A/lightmaker).

- **Turntabler**: This is a little blender addon I've created to automate my asset creation turntable process. This should ideally be a nodal setup but that one is still a work in progress. 
This is still heavily buggy and still has some performance issues..  [GitHub Repositor](https://github.com/Ans-A/Turntabler).


- **Loggy**: Loggy is a simple log analysis utility suite to handle log text files. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Ans-A/Loggy)
